You can see the code used to process the 12-month Enrollent IPEDS report in __Utilizing R for IPEDS Reporting.Rmd__. The data is in the __data__ folder.

To use this project, first clone it to your desktop and unzip to a folder of your choice.

Open ___setup.r__ with RStudio and run the script. This will make sure you have the `renv` package installed in your R environment using the command `install.packages("renv")` and will install the necessary packages in a local environment via `renv::restore()`.

Close RStudio and open the project file (__2022-11-03 CCPRO Utilizing R for IPEDS Reporting.Rproj__) in RStudio.

You can change the institution name and IPEDS number in the __config.yml__ file.

You can now run the code to see how it works.
